# Script Seeker
## Purpose
This application was built during Dev Bootcamp Phase 2. The purpose was to build something I'm passionate about and that would help me solidify the concepts I learned during Phase 2. This application was built using Sinatra, HTML5/CSS, Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Jvector map, and ResponsiveVoiceJS for text to speech.
